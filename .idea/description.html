<h1>RoundBack</h1>
<p>RoundBack is a backup client/server/server environment that is created to be platform independent, easy to use, and
easy to implement.  The RoundBack.jar will contain the Client, Master Server, and Storage Server all in one.  You can
copy this JAR file from place to place and run it anywhere that has Java 1.7 and above installed.  </p>
<p>Configuration of RoundBack uses the Java Preferences idea, and all the configuration takes place via the command
line.  The idea is a "set it and forget it" approach where you run once with the config options you want, it saves them
to the Preferences for the app you are running, and they are persistent. No more editing config files</p>
<p>RoundBack also has the ability to communicate with rudementary encryption and store files and file data in a
    rudementary encrypted way.  Better encryption algorithms may be supported in the future.
